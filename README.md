Drug abuse, including smoking and drinking, is a persistent problem in colleges. Despite efforts to curb this behavior, students are frequently fined or face suspension, which often leads to increased stress and worsens the cycle of substance abuse. Our app aims to address this issue by providing a comprehensive solution for both students and college administrations.

Data shows that punitive measures like fines have not effectively reduced drug abuse rates. Instead, our app offers a more supportive approach, helping students manage their addiction while allowing colleges to maintain better behavioral standards. Through features like group therapy, doctor consultations, and tailored support based on user input, the app facilitates recovery and promotes a healthier environment for all.
